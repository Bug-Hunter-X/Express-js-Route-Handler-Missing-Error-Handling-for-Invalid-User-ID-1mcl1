# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer but lacks error handling if the parameter is not a valid number. This can lead to unexpected application behavior or even crashes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code.  It attempts to fetch a user by ID but doesn't handle the case where the ID is not a number, potentially throwing an error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code. It includes explicit checks to validate the user ID before attempting to parse it and returns a 400 Bad Request if the ID is invalid.  This ensures robust error handling and prevents unexpected behavior.
